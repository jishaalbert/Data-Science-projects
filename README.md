ONLINE PAYMENT FRAUD DETECTION 


Online payments have become increasingly popular due to their convenience, allowing people to make payments from anywhere in the world.
Over the past few decades, the use of e-payments has grown significantly, transforming the way we handle transactions. 
This surge in popularity is attributed to the ease and speed of completing transactions without the need to visit physical stores or banks. 
Whether it’s purchasing goods, paying for services, or transferring money, e-payments provide unmatched convenience.
However, while e-payments offer numerous advantages for both consumers and businesses, they also come with inherent risks, particularly the risk of fraud. 
For consumers, ensuring that payments are directed to the correct service provider is essential to avoid fraudulent schemes.
Fraudsters often exploit the digital nature of these transactions, compromising personal data and causing significant inconvenience. 
Victims of fraud may need to go through the arduous process of reporting the incident, blocking compromised payment methods, and dealing with the aftermath of unauthorized transactions. 
This can lead to a loss of trust in online payment systems and hesitancy in using such services in the future.
For businesses, the implications of fraud are equally serious. Fraud can not only result in financial losses but also damage a company’s reputation.
Businesses may be required to issue refunds to affected customers to maintain satisfaction and loyalty, which can strain resources. 
Additionally, dealing with fraud can involve investing in enhanced security measures and compliance with regulatory standards, further adding to operational costs.
Given these potential risks, raising awareness about online scams is crucial for both consumers and businesses. Consumers need to be educated on recognizing and avoiding fraudulent activities, while businesses must implement robust security measures to protect their customers and their own operations.
By staying vigilant and informed, both parties can enjoy the benefits of e-payments while minimizing the associated risks.

Objective 

The main objective of the project is to identity and prevent fraudulent transaction in real time.
Thereby protect both user and Consumer . 
By analyzing features such as the type of payment, the total amount of the transaction, the sender's account balance before and after the transaction, the recipient's account, and the recipient's account balance before and after the transaction, and by using different machine learning algorithms. 
Here I used Logistics Reggrsion, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine,Decision Tree etc.

Result 
Based on the provided classification reports and accuracy score, the Random Forest model has achieved the highest accuracy in detecting fraudulent transaction compared to other models tested. 
This implies that the Radom Forest algorithm, which leverage multiple decision tree to make predictions, effectively captures the complexities and pattern in the dataset, making it the most reliable model for this specific classification task.
